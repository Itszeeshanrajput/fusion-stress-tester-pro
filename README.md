## 📥 Download

### Windows Executable (Recommended for Beginners)

**No Python installation required!**

[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Windows%20EXE-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows)](https://github.com/Itszeeshanrajput/fusion-stress-tester-pro/releases/latest)

**Quick Start:**
1. Download `FusionStressTesterPRO_v1.0.0_Windows.zip`
2. Extract all files
3. Double-click `FusionStressTesterPRO.exe`
4. Read `USER_GUIDE.md` for instructions

> Maintainers: publishing a GitHub Release (or pushing a `v*` tag) triggers the `Build and Attach Windows EXE` workflow, which uploads both `FusionStressTesterPRO.exe` and a Windows ZIP package to release assets. You can also run it manually with a required `tag` input to attach/refresh assets on an existing release.

**System Requirements:**
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 200MB free disk space

### Run from Source (Advanced Users)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Itszeeshanrajput/fusion-stress-tester-pro.git
cd fusion-stress-tester-pro
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fusion_stress_tester_pro_v0.0.9.py
```

## 🖥️ Installation

### Quick Start (Windows)

#### Step 1: Download the Project

**Option A: Download ZIP (Recommended for beginners)**
1. Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location

**Option B: Clone with Git**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Itszeeshanrajput/fusion-stress-tester-pro.git
cd fusion-stress-tester-pro
```

#### Step 2: Install Python

**Check if Python is installed:**
```bash
python --version
```

If you see `Python 3.10` or higher, you're good to go! Otherwise:

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the installer
3. **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Restart your terminal/command prompt

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Open terminal/command prompt in the project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/fusion-stress-tester-pro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4: GPU Support (Optional - NVIDIA Only)

For GPU stress testing with NVIDIA cards:

```bash
# Install PyTorch with CUDA support
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install NVIDIA monitoring tools
pip install pynvml
```

**Note:** GPU features require NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support. AMD/Intel GPUs are not currently supported.

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python fusion_stress_tester_pro_v0.0.9.py
```

### Quick Guide

1. **Configure Tests**
   - Select components to stress (CPU, RAM, Disk, GPU, Network)
   - Adjust intensity sliders for each component
   - Set test duration and parameters

2. **Set Safety Limits**
   - Navigate to "Safety & Monitoring" tab
   - Configure temperature thresholds
   - Set RAM and disk space limits
   - Enable automatic shutoff

3. **Start Testing**
   - Click "Start All Stress Tests" for comprehensive testing
   - Or use individual component buttons for targeted tests
   - Monitor real-time metrics in the dashboard

4. **View Results**
   - Check performance graphs for visual analysis
   - Export data to CSV for detailed review
   - Save test profiles for future use

### Test Profiles

**Light Stress** - 30-50% intensity, good for stability testing  
**Medium Stress** - 60-80% intensity, standard benchmarking  
**Heavy Stress** - 90-100% intensity, maximum performance testing

## ⚠️ Important Safety Information

### Before You Start

**🔥 Temperature Warning**
- Stress testing generates significant heat
- Ensure proper cooling and ventilation
- Monitor temperatures continuously
- Stop testing if temperatures exceed safe limits (typically 85-90°C for CPU)

**💾 SSD Endurance Mode**
- Continuous writes reduce SSD lifespan
- Use sparingly and only when necessary
- Not recommended for daily use
- Consider using HDD for disk stress tests

**🌐 Network Testing**
- UDP flood can cause network congestion
- May be flagged as malicious by ISPs
- **Only use on private networks**
- Obtain permission before testing on shared networks

**⚡ Power Supply**
- Ensure adequate PSU capacity
- Full system stress requires significant power
- Monitor for system instability

**🛡️ Liability**
- Use at your own risk
- Author not responsible for hardware damage
- Always enable safety features
- Start with lower intensity levels
